                <h2>Sass supports two different syntaxes. Each one can load the other, so it's up to you and your team which one to choose.</h2>
                <h3>SCSS</h3>
                <p>The SCSS syntax uses the file extension .scss. With a few small exceptions, it’s a superset of CSS, which means essentially all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well. Because of its similarity to CSS, it’s the easiest syntax to get used to and the most popular.</p>
                <p>SCSS looks like this:</p>
                <code>@mixin button-base() {
                    @include typography(button);
                    @include ripple-surface;
                    @include ripple-radius-bounded;
                  
                    display: inline-flex;
                    position: relative;
                    height: $button-height;
                    border: none;
                    vertical-align: middle;
                  
                    &:hover { cursor: pointer; }
                  
                    &:disabled {
                      color: $mdc-button-disabled-ink-color;
                      cursor: default;
                      pointer-events: none;
                    }
                  }
                  </code>
                <h3>The Indented Syntax</h3>
                <p>The indented syntax was Sass’s original syntax, and so it uses the file extension .sass. Because of this extension, it’s sometimes just called “Sass”. The indented syntax supports all the same features as SCSS, but it uses indentation instead of curly braces and semicolons to describe the format of the document.</p>
                <p>In general, any time you’d write curly braces in CSS or SCSS, you can just indent one level deeper in the indented syntax. And any time a line ends, that counts as a semicolon. There are also a few additional differences in the indented syntax that are noted throughout the reference.</p>
                <p>The indented syntax looks like this:</p>
                <code>@mixin button-base()
                    @include typography(button)
                    @include ripple-surface
                    @include ripple-radius-bounded
                  
                    display: inline-flex
                    position: relative
                    height: $button-height
                    border: none
                    vertical-align: middle
                  
                    &:hover
                      cursor: pointer
                  
                    &:disabled
                      color: $mdc-button-disabled-ink-color
                      cursor: default
                      pointer-events: none
                  </code>

                <h2>Style rules are the foundation of Sass, just like they are for CSS. And they work the same way: you choose which elements to style with a selector, and declare properties that affect how those elements look.</h2>

                <h2>Sass variables are simple: you assign a value to a name that begins with $, and then you can refer to that name instead of the value itself. But despite their simplicity, they're one of the most useful tools Sass brings to the table. Variables make it possible to reduce repetition, do complex math, configure libraries, and much more.</h2>
                <p>A variable declaration looks a lot like a property declaration: it’s written &lt;variable>: &lt;expression>. Unlike a property, which can only be declared in a style rule or at-rule, variables can be declared anywhere you want. To use a variable, just include it in a value.</p>

                    <p>CSS has variables of its own, which are totally different than Sass variables. Know the differences!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sass variables are all compiled away by Sass. CSS variables are included in the CSS output.</li>
                        <li>CSS variables can have different values for different elements, but Sass variables only have one value at a time.</li>
                        <li>Sass variables are imperative, which means if you use a variable and then change its value, the earlier use will stay the same. CSS variables are declarative, which means if you change the value, it’ll affect both earlier uses and later uses.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>SCSS</h3>
                    <code>$variable: value 1;

                    <h3>Fun fact:</h3>
                    <p>Sass variables, like all Sass identifiers, treat hyphens and underscores as identical. This means that $font-size and $font_size both refer to the same variable. This is a historical holdover from the very early days of Sass, when it only allowed underscores in identifier names. Once Sass added support for hyphens to match CSS’s syntax, the two were made equivalent to make migration easier.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>@use loads mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together.</li>
                    <li>@forward loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its mixins, functions, and variables available when your stylesheet is loaded with the @use rule.</li>
                    <li>@import extends the CSS at-rule to load styles, mixins, functions, and variables from other stylesheets.</li>
                    <li>@mixin and @include makes it easy to re-use chunks of styles.</li>
                    <li>@function defines custom functions that can be used in SassScript expressions.</li>
                    <li>@extend allows selectors to inherit styles from one another.</li>
                    <li>@at-root puts styles within it at the root of the CSS document.</li>
                    <li>@error causes compilation to fail with an error message.</li>
                    <li>@warn prints a warning without stopping compilation entirely.</li>
                    <li>@debug prints a message for debugging purposes.</li>
                    <li>Flow control rules like @if, @each, @for, and @while control whether or how many times styles are emitted.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sass also has some special behavior for plain CSS at-rules: they can contain interpolation, and they can be nested in style rules. Some of them, like @media and @supports, also allow SassScript to be used directly in the rule itself without interpolation.</p>

                        <p>Early on in Sass’s history, it added support for mathematical operations on colors. These operations operated on each of the colors’ RGB channels separately, so adding two colors would produce a color with the sum of their red channels as its red channel and so on.</p>
                        <p>This behavior wasn’t very useful, since it channel-by-channel RGB arithmetic didn’t correspond well to how humans perceive color. Color functions were added which are much more useful, and color operations were deprecated. They’re still supported in LibSass and Ruby Sass, but they’ll produce warnings and users are strongly encouraged to avoid them.</p>

                <h2>Sass provides many built-in modules which contain useful functions (and the occasional mixin). These modules can be loaded with the @use rule like any user-defined stylesheet, and their functions can be called like any other module member. All built-in module URLs begin with sass: to indicate that they're part of Sass itself.</h2>

                    <h3>Heads up!</h3>
                    <p>Before the Sass module system was introduced, all Sass functions were globally available at all times. Many functions still have global aliases (these are listed in their documentation). The Sass team discourages their use and will eventually deprecate them, but for now they remain available for compatibility with older Sass versions and with LibSass (which doesn’t support the module system yet).</p>
                    <p>A few functions are only available globally even in the new module system, either because they have special evaluation behavior (if()) or because they add extra behavior on top of built-in CSS functions (rgb() and hsl()). These will not be deprecated and can be used freely.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>New versions of Sass are as backwards-compatible as possible, but sometimes a breaking change is necessary. Sass needs to keep up with the evolving CSS specification, and old language design mistakes occasionally need to be fixed.</h2>
                <p>Before each breaking change is released, Sass implementations will produce deprecation warnings for stylesheets whose behavior will change. Whenever possible, these warnings will include suggestions for how to update the deprecated styles to make them forward-compatible.</p>
                <p>Different implementations have different policies for breaking changes and deprecations. Dart Sass will emit deprecation warnings for at least three months before releasing a breaking change, and will release the breaking change with a new major version number unless that change is necessary for CSS compatibility. CSS compatibility changes are often both non-disruptive and time-sensitive, so they may be released with new minor version numbers instead.</p>
                <p>These breaking changes are coming soon or have recently been released:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compound selectors could not be extended in Dart Sass 1.0.0 and Ruby Sass 4.0.0.</li>
                    <li>The syntax for CSS custom property values changed in Dart Sass 1.0.0, LibSass 3.5.0, and Ruby Sass 3.5.0.</li>
